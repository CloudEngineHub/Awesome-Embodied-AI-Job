Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship

We are looking to host talented researchers passionate about robotics and autonomous systems.

Our group focuses on robot learning and perception for navigation and manipulation — including SLAM, reinforcement learning, and differentiable physics. We are also exploring real-world engineering applications across diverse sectors such as inspection, manufacturing, and agriculture, but not limited to. 

If you're developing innovative ideas in these areas and looking for a supportive host institution, feel free to reach out. Happy to discuss potential collaboration and support your application.

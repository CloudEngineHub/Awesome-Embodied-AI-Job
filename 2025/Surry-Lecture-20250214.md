The School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering is seeking to recruit a full-time Lecturer in Robotics to expand our team of dynamic and highly skilled AI researchers.

The School is home to two established research centres with expertise in AI and Machine Learning: the Computer Science Research Centre and the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP). This post is aligned to the Nature Inspired Computer and Engineering group within Computer Science.

Surrey has an established international track record in AI research, 1st in the UK for computer vision and top 10 for AI, computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing (CSRankings) and were 7th in the UK for REF2021 outputs in Computer Science research. Computer Science and CVSSP are at the core of the Surrey Institute for People-Centred AI (PAI), established in 2021 as a pan-University initiative which brings together leading AI research with cross-discipline expertise across health, social, behavioural, and engineering sciences, and business, law, and the creative arts to shape future AI to benefit people and society. PAI leads a portfolio of £100m in grant awards including major research activities in creative industries and healthcare, and two doctoral training programmes with funding for over 100 PhD researchers: the UKRI AI Centre for Doctoral Training in AI for Digital Media Inclusion, and the Leverhulme Trust Doctoral Training Network in AI-Enabled Digital Accessibility.

Surrey has long-standing expertise in robotics focusing on robot learning, data-driven modelling and control, and human-robot interaction/collaboration. Our researchers solve real-world problems including the areas of agricultural robotics, space robotics, and autonomous systems.

This role encourages applicants from the areas of robotics including robotic learning and manipulation, planning, control, multi-modal generative AI in robotic grasping or manipulation, or who bring complementary areas of AI expertise to drive innovation in robotics.

This post will support the growing cohort of students across all undergraduate Computer Science programmes including the new Computer Science and AI programme and will support students in the highly successful MSc in AI and MSc in Data Science.

What we can offer

The postholder will benefit from the support of colleagues within the School to develop their careers. The School’s welcoming community recognises the need to nurture its staff and to help them build a flourishing career. You will become a member of the Institute for People-Centred AI supporting the growth of collaborative cross-disciplinary research and training as Surrey delivers its future vision.

In addition to salary, you will receive a yearly incremental pay rise, generous annual leave entitlement of 30 days holiday plus 7 university closure days and 8 bank holidays (pro rata for part time roles), a generous pension, access to world-class leisure facilities on campus, a range of travel schemes, and supportive family friendly benefits including an excellent on-site nursery.

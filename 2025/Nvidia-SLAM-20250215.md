# About the job

Intelligent machines powered by Artificial Intelligence computers that can learn, reason and interact with people are no longer science fiction. Today, a self-driving car powered by AI can meander through a country road at night and find its way. An AI-powered robot can learn motor skills through trial and error. Do you agree with us that this truly is an extraordinary time and that the era of AI has begun? We are proud that NVIDIA is playing a meaningful role in this development, where our hardware and software platforms power a large eco-system of partners who are working to deliver products, all over the world. In the space of self-driving cars, NVIDIA provides the DRIVE AGX hardware platform which runs our DRIVE software.

We are looking for Senior Autonomous Vehicles Engineers to join us. An always available map helps tremendously for reliable autonomous driving. In this role, you will help build robust solutions for using our own maps for parking garages, our crowd sourced maps as well as ubiquitous navigation maps in our driving stack.

# What You'll Be Doing

- Design and build robust and accurate solutions for map enhanced autonomous driving.
- Localize to map data to provide the most precise and rich model of the environment around the car, including beyond the horizon of perception.
- Make sure our algorithms work well on large amounts of real and synthetic data, in a diverse range of environments and conditions.
- Write safe, highly efficient real-time code in C++, making use of algorithmic parallelism offered by GPGPU programming in CUDA.
- Productize all software for real-world deployment to consumer cars, following automotive quality and safety standards (MISRA, ISO26262).

# What We Need To See

- BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science or equivalent experience.
- 15 + years of proven experience.
- Hands on experience in working on computer vision, 3D geometry, mapping, localization, route & lane planning or related technologies within autonomous vehicles or robotics.
- Outstanding communication and teamwork skills, as this project requires both cross-team collaboration and work in a tightly-knit team.
- Meticulous craftsmanship of software in modern C++.
- A solid foundation in linear algebra and geometric computer vision.

# Ways To Stand Out From The Crowd

- Significant industry experience in above areas.
- Experience developing real-time Computer Vision systems.
- Background with CUDA parallel programming

We believe that realizing self-driving cars will be a defining contribution of our generation (e.g. traffic accidents cause ~1.25 million deaths per year world-wide). We have the funding and scale, but we need your help on our team! NVIDIA is widely considered to be one of the technology worldâ€™s most desirable employers with some of the most forward-thinking and hardworking people in the world working here. If you're creative and autonomous, we want to hear from you!

# Project description
Third-cycle subject: Computer Science 

Social robotics is a rapidly expanding field; with more advanced human-like robots proliferating within, e.g., education. It is also changing drastically with the introduction of large language models (LLM) that can be used to allow social robots to interact more naturally with humans in different application areas. However, the use of LLM also signifies that developers have less control over the robots' interaction than when they are pre-programmed. In particular, LLMs may output incorrect or made-up information.

Developers and users alike need to handle this situation, not the least when robots are used in education, since incorrect information may harm learning. Investigating and improving learning situations in which students interact with robots that may not always provide correct information will therefore be of particular interest for the doctoral studies. Exploring the influence of factors such as the students' background and AI experience on their trust in the robot and how multimodal robot signals (word choice, voice features and facial expressions) could indicate how certain the robot is about the information provided are other central themes.

As doctoral student you will get to perform multi-disciplinary research combining technical skills (e.g., programming of social robots, training of AI models, data analysis), human-centered design (e.g., implementation and evaluation of student-robot interaction scenarios), and education research (e.g., applying didactic frameworks). The research will be conducted in close collaboration with experts in social robotics at KTH and Uppsala University and in human-centred AI for learning, with many international contacts and national collaborations, e.g., in the Wallenberg AI Autonomous Systems and Software Program – Humanities and Society.

**Supervision**: Professor Olov Engwall, Associate professor Olga Viberg, Assistant professor Katie Winkle (Uppsala Universitet)
